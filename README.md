- [ How Schools Can Use ](#how-schools-use-this-system-step-by-step-for-non-technical-users)

- [‎☞ Built and Designed For](#built-and-designed-for)

- [ඏ Project Origin](#project-origin)


### ❓ Q1. What Special Features Have We Added That Most Systems in Ghana & Africa have not yet Seen ?

Simply we say;
####  1. A Decentralized Management Architecture  
####  2. Scalable User Permission System  
####  3. Controlled Role-Based Access  

Together, we call this:

## 🔐 R1 **Separation of Power Role Based Access Design**

Implemented via clearly defined roles:

- **Super Admins** : Global oversight & auditing
- **Department Admins** : Local, scoped access to their own department data

> ✓ Ensures accountability, clarity, scalability, and structured control.

---

##  R2. Smart Admission Decision Flow (1st, 2nd, 3rd Choice Ranking)

- If **1st choice** rejects → automatically flows to **2nd choice**
- If **2nd choice** rejects → automatically flows to **3rd choice**
- If **all 3 choices** reject → applicant is **politely rejected**

> ✓ Makes admission more dynamic, intelligent, and fair

---

## 🏛 R3. Departmental Autonomy + Central Control

- Each **department** sees **only their applicants**
- **Super Admin** sees **all data globally** and can audit any activity

> ✓ Prevents overload  
> ✓ Boosts clarity  
> ✓ Strengthens data security and accountability

---

## 📄 R4. Dynamic WAEC Results Stored in JSON Format

We use JSON format instead of hardcoded database fields to store WAEC results.

### Benefits:
- ✓ **Dynamic filtering** and **rule-based parsing**
- ✓ **AI-ready** scoring engine for future expansion
- ✓ **Easy schema updates** without altering table structures

---

## 📧 R5. Automation: Emails + PDF Receipts

As soon as an applicant submits:

- ✓ An **automated email** is sent
- ✓ A **PDF receipt** is generated and stored
- ✓ The student has **instant proof of submission**

> Enhances transparency, user trust, and system professionalism.

---

## ⚙️ R6. Auto-Admit Engine (Underrated Genius)

A unique module that auto-admits qualified applicants based on subject-grade criteria.

-  Uses `criteria_json` rules for fast validation
- ✓ Reduces manual workload
- ✓ Minimizes human bias
- ✓ Enables real-time admission

> A simple, scalable **semi-AI decision engine** without expensive AI tools.

---

##  R7. LAN-Based Multi-Client VB.NET Administration App

- The system works **locally over LAN**
- **Multiple department admins** can log in from different computers
- ✓ No internet needed  
- ✓ Fast, secure, and cost-effective deployment

---

## R8 Audit Logs & Admission Flow Tracking

Every action is logged in:

- `logs` table  
- `admission_flow_log` table

Each entry contains:

- 🕒 Timestamp  
- 🌐 IP Address  
- 👤 Responsible Admin  
- 📋 Decision Reason  

> ✓ Full transparency for accountability and auditing (even for regulators)

## How Schools Use This System Step by Step for Non-Technical Users

This guide explains how **students**, **department admins**, and **super admins** can use the system — no IT skills needed.

---

### 👨‍🎓 1. Student: How to Apply for Admission

1. **Visit the Application Portal:**
   - Open the link provided by the school (e.g. `http://localhost/intelligent_portal/` or a public Ngrok/Cloudflare link).

2. **Fill the Online Form:**
   - Enter personal details, SHS subjects and WAEC grades.
   - Choose your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd program preferences.
   - Upload any required documents.

3. **Submit Application:**
   - Click **Submit** after reviewing.
   - A **PDF receipt** is downloaded automatically.
   - A **confirmation email** is sent instantly.

4.  **Done!** The system now takes over with auto-screening.

---

### 🤖 2. Auto-Admit System: Smart, Instant Admission

If a student’s **WAEC grades match the admission criteria** of their:

- **1st choice** → The system **automatically admits** the student.
- ❌ If rejected → Automatically moves to **2nd choice**
- ❌ If rejected again → Moves to **3rd choice**
- ❌ If all 3 fail → A polite rejection message is generated.

 Criteria is stored in the system as smart rules (e.g., must get at least C6 in Math and English for BSc programs).

> 🎯 This eliminates bias, saves time, and ensures fair admission.

### 🧑‍💼 3. Department Admin: What You Can Do

1. **Open the Admin App:**
   - Double-click the Windows application (no browser needed).
